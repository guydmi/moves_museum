**Add an animation scultpure**

The prefab Stand comes with some cool features, including a sculpture of the animation. 
To create one :
- Drag and drop your animation in the Resources folder
- Drag and drop a stand object in your scene
- Inside the stand object in the scene :
	- Stand/Statue/SculptureObject : give the animationPath, drag and drop the skeleton in the skeleton prefab and give a unique sculpture id. In the Material 1 field you can choose whatever material you want for your sculpture to be. 
	- Stand/panneau/Plane/Menu_sculpture : if not already there, drag and drop the sculptureObjet previously modified in the sculpture on time field
Enjoy!
